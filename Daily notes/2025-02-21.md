# IMT

## Semantic web

Many levels:
- lightweight
	- data in web pages (Schema.org ... )
- lightweight
	- Rich information
	- linked data
- Heavyweight

## Google rich snippets

Rich snippets are the guiding info which usually appears in [[IMT_Jﾄ電zieni#Google|Google]] search results

For these rich snippets to appear properly, you can use the `itemprop` html tag property.

## Schema.org

[Schema.org - Schema.org](https://schema.org/)

The purpose of schema.org is to organise a vocabulary so all major search engines operate on the same data. It allows to mark up information about specific things described in the pages.

### Principles

- Started simple:
	- ~100 categories at launch
	- Now over 1200 categories
- Move fast, mistakes are fine
- Organisation in hierarchies
	- Everything is a `Thing`
	- `Thing`s are become more specific
	- For example, `Person`, `VideoObject`, `Country`

### Schemas and the semantic web

Search engines can use schema.org to get a more complete set of data from various places.
