## Bag of words

Text converted into a set of word occurrences.
These occurrences are counted.

From [[2025-02-07#Bag of words]]

## Boolean retrieval model

Each document is a [[IMT_Jēdzieni#Bag of words|bag of words]].
Query contains Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT
Search the documents for bags matching query.

The same principle could be applied with keywords.

This is a data *filtering* model, not a *sorting* model.

## Information Retrieval (IR)

Termins, kas radies ap 1950-ajiem.

Apzīmē meklēšanu tekstā, teksta līdzību, mūsdienās iekļauj matemātiskus modeļus meklēšanai tekstā.

Vēlāk ar interneta parādīšanos arī saišu analīze.

For example, recognizing reviews.

## Word Proximity

An extra operator that can be introduced in a [[#Boolean retrieval model]] that can look at distance of words in the original text.

This does mean that the model needs the original text, not just a [[#Bag of words]].
